# VGA_CONTROLLER
The assumption of the project is to create a video controller on the Artix-7 layout. It supports the VGA interface and displays an 8-bit image with a resolution of 160x120px. The image is stored in RAM. In addition, the system has a UART receiver that allows you to send an image from a PC via a serial interface.
